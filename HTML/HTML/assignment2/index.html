                that helped a team win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1985. After graduate school, Walt founded the firm Gray Matter Technologies with Elliott Schwartz (Adam Godley), his former classmate and close friend. Around this 
                time, Walt dated his lab assistant, Gretchen (Jessica Hecht). Gretchen and Elliott later married and made a fortune, much of it from Walt's research.

               Growing up under the eye of family butler Edwin Jarvis, his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father.
               This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. Stark proved to be a brilliant and unique child prodigy, he attended MIT for two years starting at age 14.
